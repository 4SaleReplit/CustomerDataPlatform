Clause & Other Keywords (DISTINCT, LIMIT, QUALIFY, OVER, CASE, WHEN, THEN, ELSE, END)	Cyans, Purples	#8BE9FD, #BD93F9	These are important but often secondary to the primary keywords.

Strings (e.g., 'hello world')	Greens, Oranges, Yellows	#50FA7B, #CE9178, #E6DB74	Should be clearly distinguishable from keywords and comments.
Numeric Values (e.g., 123, 45.67)	Light Greens, Light Blues, Purples	#B5CEA8, #BD93F9, #66D9EF	Consistent coloring helps in quickly identifying numerical data.
Boolean Values (TRUE, FALSE)	Oranges, Purples	#FFB86C, #BD93F9	Often share a color with other constants or numeric values.
NULL	Grays, Reds	#6272A4, #FF5555	NULL is a special case and should ideally have a unique, noticeable color.
⚙️ Functions & Types
These define the logic and structure of your data.

Element	Recommended Colors	Hex Code Examples	Notes
Built-in Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, TO_CHAR, IFF, etc.)	Yellows, Light Blues, Greens	#F1FA8C, #DCDCAA, #A6E22E	Makes your business logic pop.

Parentheses, Commas, Semicolons ((), ,, ;)	Default Text Color	#F8F8F2, #D4D4D4	Usually best to keep these neutral to avoid visual clutter.
