Here is a complete list for an autocomplete function based on a Snowflake SQL query editor. This list is broken down into logical categories to make it easier to implement and manage.

Keywords
Keywords are the foundational words in SQL that specify the actions to be performed. A robust autocomplete should suggest these whenever a new word is started.

Functions
Snowflake has a rich library of functions. Your autocomplete should be context-aware, suggesting aggregate functions after a GROUP BY clause, for instance.

Database Objects
This part of the autocomplete is dynamic and must be populated by querying the database's information schema.

Tables and Views: After a FROM or JOIN clause, the autocomplete should suggest a list of tables and views available in the current database and schema.
Columns: When in a SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY clause, the autocomplete should suggest column names from the tables specified in the FROM clause.
Schemas: When writing a fully qualified object name (e.g., my_schema.my_table), the autocomplete should suggest available schemas.
Databases: Your editor could allow switching between databases, and the autocomplete should suggest the available databases. Here's a complete list for an autocomplete function based on a Snowflake SQL query editor, broken down into logical categories.

Context-Aware Autocomplete
For a truly intelligent editor, the autocomplete should be context-aware.

Table and Column Names: After a FROM or JOIN clause, the editor should suggest available table names within the current database and schema. After a table is specified, it should suggest the column names of that table in SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses.

To implement this, you would need to query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA:
For tables: SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM YOUR_DATABASE.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
For columns: SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM YOUR_DATABASE.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'YOUR_TABLE';
Schema and Database Names: When using fully qualified object names (e.g., mydatabase.myschema.mytable), the editor should suggest available databases and schemas.

This comprehensive list provides a solid foundation for a powerful and helpful autocomplete feature in a Snowflake SQL query editor.
