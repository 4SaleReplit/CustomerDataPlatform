Do not at all make any changes in the current front or logic of the email templates section.. Keep it as it is‚Ä¶ all changes are in the email sender scope exclusively. 
‚ùå Delete the Existing Email Sender Form
Completely remove the current implementation of the Email Sender Form from the codebase.


Delete all related files and components without keeping any fallback or root reference.


Rationale: The current version is fundamentally incorrect, buggy, and not maintainable.



‚úÖ Rebuild the Email Sender Form ‚Äì Correctly & Cleanly

1. Section One: Report Selection & Preview
Add a dropdown to choose between:


"Existing Report"


"Template Report"


Based on the selection:


Show a second dropdown with actual reports or templates fetched from the database.


Do not use mock data. Fetch from /reports and /templates tables or APIs.


To the right of the dropdowns:


Show a PDF previewer box.


Preview the selected report/template PDF by loading its actual S3 URL.


Allow swiping or navigation across pages of the PDF.



2. Section Two: Email Template Selection & Final Preview
Show a dropdown of available email templates stored in the database.


Load from the real email_templates source, no static data.


When a template is selected:


On the right side, render a final email preview.


Use the exact style of Gmail's inbox view (as seen in the Gmail mobile app or web client).


The preview should render the selected report inside the email, as if the recipient is viewing the email they received.
