Create a network rule
You need the CREATE NETWORK RULE privilege on the schema to create a network rule. By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN and SECURITYADMIN roles, along with the schema owner, have this privilege.

The mode of a network rule that will be used by a network policy must be INGRESS or INTERNAL STAGE.

To gain a better understand of best practices and strategies for creating network rules, see About network rules.

You can create a network rule using Snowsight or by executing a SQL command:

Snowsight
Sign in to Snowsight.

Select Admin Â» Security.

Select the Network Rules tab.

Select + Network Rule.

Enter the name of the network rule.

Select the schema of the network rule. Network rule are schema-level objects.

Optionally, add a descriptive comment for the network rule to help organize and maintain network rules in the schema.

In the Type drop-down, select the type of identifier being defined in the network rule. The Host Port type is not a valid option for network rules being used with network policies.

In the Mode drop-down, select Ingress or Internal Stage. The Egress mode is not a valid option for network rules being used with network policies.

Enter a comma-separated list of the identifiers that will be allowed or blocked when the network rule is added to a network policy. The identifiers in this list must all be of the type specified in the Type drop-down.

Select Create Network Rule.

SQL
An administrator can execute the CREATE NETWORK RULE command to create a new network rule, specifying a list of network identifiers along with the type of those identifiers.

For example, to use a custom role to create a network rule that can be used to allow or block traffic from a range of IP addresses:

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE securitydb TO ROLE network_admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA securitydb.myrules TO ROLE network_admin;
GRANT CREATE NETWORK RULE ON SCHEMA securitydb.myrules TO ROLE network_admin;
USE ROLE network_admin;

CREATE NETWORK RULE cloud_network TYPE = IPV4 VALUE_LIST = ('47.88.25.32/27');
